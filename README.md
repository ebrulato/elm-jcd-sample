# Elm-jdc-sample

The purpose of this application is to test the Elm ecosystem.
I will try to update this application to test some Elm behaviors with some real data. Thanks to JCD which provides a simple API to their services.

## Inspiration

I based my work on the excellent Elm SPA Sample provided by [elm-spa-example]( https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example), but as I am learning Elm, I  removed a lot of stuff that I don't need (or understand very well). My purpose is just to create my first Elm App and to learn Elm in a "real" context. So, I don't want to integrate too much complexity.  

## Installation

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
See [here](application.md) for details (default readme).

## DONE

* 12 hours of work (learning curve measure) Before I've learned Elm with some little exercises and read a lot of article about it.
* elm-lang/geolocation to compute the distance with the stations
* NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline to deal with the http request response.
* elm-lang/navigation
* lukewestby/elm-http-builder which is great to make Http request

## TODO

* Use local storage to store the contract selected
* Update the interface to have a better experience (with tachyon)
* Add a shortlink installer (PWA style)
